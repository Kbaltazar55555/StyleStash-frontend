## Contribution
Follow the coding conventions and practices as outlined in the project's guidelines.
For new features or bug fixes, create a separate branch away from main and dev.
After changes, perform a safety pull from the "test development" branch before initiating a pull request.
Major Dev pushes/pulls from any singular team member will require the approval of all 4 team memebers.
Regularly sync your branches with your main repository branch. Best practice to also store it locally. Verbally communicate changes.

# Daily Meetings
Morning check-ins with Emre and mid-day check-ins with the team.
Office meetings with Grant as needed.
